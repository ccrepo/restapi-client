# Project: RestAPI-Client

Project RestAPI-Client is a simple command line tool which can be used to send RestApi commands to REST servers.

Simple Http POST and GET have alerady implemented.

Additional functionality (PUT, DELETE. https, transactions) will be added over time.

Content-Type in all cases is json.

I use this tool during my own Spring/REST development and will gradually expand it in line with that.
